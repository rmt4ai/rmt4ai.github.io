# 2024 DIMACS Workshop on Modeling Randomness in Neural Network Training

## Mathematical, Statistical, and Numerical Guarantees

The DIMACS Workshop on Modeling Randomness in Neural Network Training: Mathematical, Statistical, and Numerical Guarantees will be held at the [DIMACS Center](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu/) from **June 5-7, 2024**. The central question of this workshop is: *what can random matrix theory tell us about neural networks, modern machine learning, and AI?*

One goal of the workshop will be to create bridges between the different mathematical and computational communities by bringing together researchers with a diverse set of perspectives on neural networks. Topics of interest include:

* understanding matrix-valued random processes that arise during NN training, 
* modeling/measuring uncertainty and designing estimators for training processes,
* applications to these designs within optimization algorithms.
